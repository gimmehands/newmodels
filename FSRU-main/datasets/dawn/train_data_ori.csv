It also highlights the need for better public transportation options to reduce congestion and improve overall air quality. Furthermore, it's important to note that exposure to high levels of PM2.5 particles over extended periods can cause serious health issues such as lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
